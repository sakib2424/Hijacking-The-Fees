# Hijacking-The-Fees

The board of directors are very impatient. It has been 5 days since the company restarted and the economy has not collapsed into itself. This suggests that the finance department needs to be sacked and has been thrown into the fourth closest sun.

The board has decided to increase the fees for the parks by at least 4 million altairian dollars. Some others think it might be better to increase each park individually and there are some who think it might be better to increase the fees of multiple parks at the same time. The finer points are still under scrutiny whereas the chairman is nowhere to be found after he went to take a stroll in the park.

They have decided that you, having helped implement the database in the first place, would be a good choice as a programmer to do the updates in the system.

There will be three types of queries to the database
* insert a planet with name  and entrance fee  into the database
* increase the entrance fee for all planets between  by 
* return the entrance fee for a planet name  from the database
